# Introduction
This document is mostly written to explain how the smash.gg API works by giving indept examples and explanation.
Output models will be described as they are in SmashggNet.

# Context
This project is mostly a fan project made to be used in AtlasBot and later start as an OpenSource project on GitHub.
This API client will be used in more of my personal projects later down the line but I can not disclose these as of now.

# Characters and Stages
The characters and stage list can be download as a csv file at [this link for characters](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/341777825227079680/416002121746612234/stages.csv) and [here for stages](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/341777825227079680/416002121746612234/stages.csv).
These files are created by smash.gg and were originally uploaded by [keef](https://github.com/keithrobichaud). Later down the line there will be an implementation of the character and stage lists that is togglable.

# Discord
For any questions related to the API itself, I recommend joining the [smash.gg discord](https://bit.ly/smashggdiscord) and asking your questions in the #api chat.
